==========================

Hello, my name is Fox. I am studying web design at BTH. 

I was born in New Jersey and mostly grew up in one small town in New Jersey. I did not have any pets until
I was 15, when a small kitten showed up at my house, which wasn't all that unusual, but she stuck around and I
adopted her. Her name is Hunter, she is 10 years old now. Also a Rhode Island Red Rooster showed up in that year too,
and I adopted him as well, his name was Carl. I miss my cat. 
I moved to Sweden when I was 19, on December 26th I flew from JFK International Airport in New York, and I arrived
early on December 27th to Stockholm. I was met by my sambo, Simon, and we took the train to Uppsala and went to our
first apartment together. We lived in Uppsala for a year and a half before we moved to Stockholm. We moved to Kista,
where we did not live for very long, maybe 5 months or so, before we moved to Kungshamra, which was very nice. After 
living in Kungshamra for a year we moved to Älvsjö, which I also loved a lot. After, we moved to Malmö, where we
have lived for 2 and a half years almost. I miss Uppsala the most, I think.
I studied Swedish for some of those years, all of gymnasie svenska and I also studied some stuff to prepare for an 
engineering degree, physics, chemistry, and math 4.
