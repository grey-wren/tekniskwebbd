==================
I have never worked with frameworks or CMS ever before. No I haven't been familiar with any of the new programs in the lab. I have 
used a colour picker tool quite often in art applications. I had not used it for this specifically but it's very helpful and works the same.
Yes I do have ideas about what makes good web design and how to appeal to the user. I think about it a lot, actually. I have talked to people
with different backgrounds in programming, and with a friend who is blind and must use a screenreader about usability. These kinds of
things are very often forgotten. In web design it's important to consider colours and things also, which is another thing people do not
remember or think about. For example, I am easily overwhelmed by bright colours so I have to use different add-ons to accomodate this, 
dark reader for example. I also am very interested in typography and what looks good in general. Typography wise it should suit to
the message, the audience, and the format. Often I see serifed fonts being used for huge amounts of text on screens, in teeny tiny little fonts
that are impossible to read. So the user would lose interest very quickly or at the very least, likely have a difficult time with it.
    It didn't go as well as I had hoped. It was very difficult, actually. I am not happy with it currently, but I think its something that 
I had trouble understanding at some point, but I tried, but I know it isn't right. On this mission I learned mostly about the new folder 
organisation and how it looks in ".twig".
